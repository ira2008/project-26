#recipe of rasgulla 
1. Take 1 litre of whole milk in a pan and keep it to boil on a low to medium flame. I used organic cow milk which does not have much fat. If you use buffalo milk, it has too much of fat and makes for a thick layer of malai/cream floating on top. You have to remove the thick layer of malai, before you proceed with the making of chenna.
2. So when the milk is heating up, line a strainer or bowl with a cheese cloth or muslin.
3. Keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the froth is not formed on top and the base does not get browned or the milk solids get stuck to the bottom.
4. When the milk comes to a boil, then reduce the flame to its lowest. Add 1 to 3 tbsp lemon juice. First add 1 tbsp lemon juice and stir very well. If the milk has not curdled completely, then add 1 tbsp more. Keep the lemon juice handy with you. Depending on the quality of milk, you may need to add 1 to 3 tbsp of lemon juice. Stir after adding the lemon juice. Sometimes I have added 1 tbsp lemon juice and the milk has curdled and sometimes I needed to add 3 tbsp too. Vinegar also can be added instead of lemon juice. Another option is curd/yogurt. Add 4 to 5 tbsp of yogurt or more if required. With yogurt you donâ€™t need to rinse the chenna in water later.
5. As soon as the milk curdles, switch off the flame. The milk should curdle completely with the green watery whey.
6. Now pour the curdled milk in the cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer or bowl. Reserve the whey and add it to your chapati dough or in dals or curries. The whey is very nutritious, so donâ€™t discard it.
7. Gather the muslin from the sides and rinse the chenna or coagulated milk solids very well in running water. This brings down the temperature of chenna as well as removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna.
8. Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.8. Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.
9. Place a heavy weight on the chenna for 7 to 8 minutes. You can also hang the chenna for about 30 minutes.
10. After 7 to 8 minutes, remove the cheesecloth from the chenna. Note that the chenna should not have too much moisture nor be too dry.
11. Add 1 tsp unroasted sooji or rava or semolina. The rava I had were a bit coarse. Fine rava or sooji also works very well. You can also add all purpose flour/maida. Adding either of them helps to bind the mixture. For a gluten-free option, add 1 tsp corn starch instead of semolina or all purpose flour.
12. First mix the sooji with chenna and then begin to knead. while kneading chenna, if you see that it is moist or watery, then this means that there is more water. You can add some maida (all purpose flour) so that extra moisture is absorbed. Alternatively, keep a heavy weight on the chenna again so that the extra water or whey gets drained. If the chenna looks crumbly and dry, then this means that there is less moisture in it. So to correct this, sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of water while kneading. This will add some moisture in the chenna. Some moisture in chenna helps in binding.
13. With the heels of your palms mash the chenna and knead. Keep on collecting the chenna from the sides and continue to mash and knead. This kneading process is very important and also decides the texture of chenna. When you feel your palms becoming a bit greasy, its time to stop. Just a bit of greasiness is required. Avoid kneading to an extent where the whole chenna becomes greasy. I kneaded for about 10 minutes as I have very light hands. So depending on the quality of chenna and the pressure you apply while kneading, you can take more or less time. Note that the chenna should just begin to get greasy.
14. Knead to a smooth ball of chenna which should be able to come together without breaking or falling apart.
15. Now pinch small portions from the chenna and roll them between your palms to a smooth round ball.
16. Prepare all small balls this way. there will be fine cracks on the chenna balls and its fine to have them ðŸ™‚
17. Cover all the chenna balls with a moist muslin or kitchen towel and keep aside.

sugar syrup for rasgulla recipe

18. In a large pan, take 2 cups sugar.
19. add 4 cups water (1 litre). I used organic raw sugar and hence the orangish golden tones to it. You have to use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the rasgulla to cook and increase in size. You can also use a pressure cooker. I used a pan measuring 8.5 inches in diameter and 4.5 inches in height. Basically a 3.4 litre stainless steel pan.

20. Keep this pan on stove top and heat the sugar solution. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. Just lightly heat and stir so that the sugar dissolves. You donâ€™t need to heat more or boil the solution. If there are impurities in the sugar solution, then move to the next step. If no impurities, then move to Step 26. I kneaded the chenna and cooked the sugar syrup simultaneously. You can also do this way.

21. Add 1 tbsp milk and stir. Adding milk helps in removing impurities. If there are no impurities then you donâ€™t need to add milk and directly proceed to step 26.

22. Once the sugar solution becomes hot, the impurities begin to float on the top.

23. You can either remove it with a spoon.

24. Or strain the impurities in a cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer. I prefer this method.

25. From the filtered sugar solution (or if you have not filtered the sugar solution) reserve Â½ cup of it in a cup or mug. This Â½ cup of sugar solution we will be adding while cooking the rasgulla.

26. Reserve another 1 cup of the filtered sugar solution in a serving bowl.

27. Add the rest of the 2.5 cups sugar solution back to the same large pan and bring it to a boil on a medium high flame.

28. Slid the rasgulla gently into the sugar solution.

29. Once all the rasgulla have been added to the sugar solution, shake the pan. Donâ€™t stir the rasgulla with a spoon. Just gently shake the pan.

30. Cover immediately with a lid and let them cook. Keep the flame to a medium or medium high.

31. After 4 minutes, open the lid and add Â¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Shake the pan. Adding this reserved sugar solution ensures that the temperature & consistency of the sugar solution is maintained and the sugar does not cook to its thread consistencies.

32. Cover again and continue to cook.

33. After 4 minutes, again add Â¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Cover and again cook for 2 minutes. I cooked for a total of 10 minutes.

34. After 10 minutes the rasgulla had increased in size and were cooked. Once they are cooked, switch off the flame and keep the pan down. The time to cook rasgulla will vary depending on the thickness & quality of pan, the size of pan and the intensity of the flame. So the time range can be somewhere between 7 to 11 minutes. So you can add the Â¼ cup sugar syrup after 2 to 3 minutes also instead of 4 minutes. I used a thick bottomed wide and deep pan, so the cooking time was slightly more for me.

35. There are two ways to check the doneness of rasgulla.

    First method is to place the rasgulla in a bowl or cup of water. If the rasgulla sinks to the bottom and stays there, its cooked.
    Second method is to press a small portion of the rasgulla with your finger. If the pressed portion bounces back to its original shape, its done. You have to check the doneness, while the rasgulla are simmering. So just take one rasgulla with a spoon and add it to the bowl of water. If the rasgulla does not settle down at the bottom and floats on top of the water, then you need to cook them further.

36. Once they are cooked, take each rasgulla with a spoon.

37. And place it in the serving bowl containing the reserved 1 cup of sugar solution. Cover and keep aside.

38. Let the sugar solution in which the rasgulla were cooked, become warm. Then add this sugar solution to the serving bowl containing the rasgulla.

39. Once the whole mixture has cooled down, add 1 to 2 tbsp rose water. If you donâ€™t have rose water you can also kewra water (pandanus extract) or Â½ tsp cardamom powder. You can even use both rose water and cardamom powder. Stir gently. Some flavoring has to be added, otherwise you will get a milky taste in the rasgulla. In case the milky taste is there, then you can increase the amount of rose water or add 1 teaspoon cardamom powder. Allow them to be soaked in the syrup for about 30 minutes, so that the flavorings gets infused in them.

40. You can serve the rasgulla now or refrigerate them and serve later.
